              <p>My name is Alexander Mastryukov. I spend a lot of my time playing,
                designing and programming video games, and also indulge in environment design,
                graphic design and music production. Video games have been my
                passion for as long as I can remember, and I work
                diligently in my free time to contribute to the art and science
                of video game creation.
                <br><br>
                Over the years, I have acquired an assortment of skills relevant
                to my passion, and have used them to create various projects. This
                website is one of them. You can check out more by visiting the
                'Portfolio' tab in the header.

                To expand my horizons and learn more about technology and video games,
                I have started a blog, where I will post my thoughts on various
                articles and topics related to video games and technology I stumble
                upon the web. To read my blog, visit the 'Blog' tab in the header.
